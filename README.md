# CargoAngularChallenge

Project Verifies when is the best day to buy and sell stocks, trying to get a Max Profit from it. If it's not possible to get a profit, response will be 0, and will be displayed as `None`. On Navigation, the best day to buy and sell will be displayed (on terms of array position, 0...n), along side the Max Profit generated and the data used for the algorithm.

A [live example](https://cargoangularchallenge-dljtejuq.b4a.run/) is available for testing, otherwise, code from `main` branch can be used to test locally.

## Pre-requistes

Have [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1 installed.

Run `npm install` before running the application in order to get the proper libraries installed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
